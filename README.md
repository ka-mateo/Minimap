# RedPixel Minimap

A minimap script for the website PixelCanvas.io hosting templates of the faction named RedPixel. Approval of templates for the minimap will be handled by the faction's Deputies, Commissars of Art, and Commissars of Science. Please contact ka mateo#1754 (ID: 333082447480750082) or any other a Premier in the [RedPixel Discord Server](https://discord.me/redpixel) if you are a Comrade who wishes to contribute a template to the minimap.

### Important note
Due to copyright issues, the actual script had to be taken down from the repository, and won't be available anymore without explicit consent of it's original creator. Ask around the [RedPixel Discord Server](https://discord.me/redpixel) to find out more about that.

If you installed the script previously, it will still work perfectly fine, as updates to the templates are done by change of the files outside of the script, which remain in this repository.
